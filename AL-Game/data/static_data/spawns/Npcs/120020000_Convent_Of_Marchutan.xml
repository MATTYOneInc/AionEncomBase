		<Weapon Distributor>
		Strength of muscle and of heart is what brings victory.
		That is why I build my body and skills every day.
		I was small and weak as a Human, but you wouldn't know that now, would you ?
		I've heard Louizze rant about the value of defense, but I think it's she who is short-sighted.
		Why do you need to survive the enemy if you land the killing blow first?
		But you haven't come to join in our debate, have you ?
		These weapons will serve you well in the Abyss -->

		<!-- Louizze
		<Armor Distributor>
		Sometimes Asmodians like Leokev put too much value and trust in offensive capability.
		Such a shame, and so short sighted.
		We value life just as much as the Elyos.
		After all, only those who survive the enemies' blows are able to land blows of their own.
		Of course if you've been to the Abyss, you likely understand that already.
		Perhaps your talking to me is proof show me that you do understand -->
